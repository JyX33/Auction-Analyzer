# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. App Overview

**App Name:**  (To be decided - perhaps something like "Blizzard Item Data Extractor" or "Game Item DB Builder" - do you have a name in mind?)
**Description:** A backend service designed to extract item data from the Blizzard API, focusing on item class and subclass information. This data will be stored in a SQLite database and eventually served through an API for web applications.
**Tagline:**  "Extracting and organizing game item data from the Blizzard API."

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary User (Initial):**  Myself (the developer) for personal project and data exploration.
**Secondary User (Future):** Website users interested in accessing and viewing structured game item data. These users are likely players of the game who want to look up item classifications.

**User Personas:**

* **Developer (You):**  Needs a reliable and efficient way to extract and store item data from the Blizzard API for personal projects and learning.
* **Website User (Future):** Wants to quickly and easily find the class and subclass of game items through a user-friendly website interface (which will use the API we are building).

## 3. Key Features

**Priority 1 (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):**

* **Data Extraction:**
  * Accepts a comma-separated list of item IDs as input.
  * Fetches item data from the Blizzard API for each ID.
  * Extracts "class" and "subclass" information from the API response.
  * Handles Blizzard API rate limits gracefully.
  * Implements concurrent requests to speed up data extraction.
* **Data Storage:**
  * Stores the extracted item data (item ID, class, subclass, and potentially other relevant data from the API) in a SQLite database.

**Priority 2 (Future Enhancements):**

* **API Endpoint:**
  * Develop a RESTful API endpoint to serve item data from the SQLite database.
  * Allow querying items by ID, class, subclass, etc. (details to be defined later).
* **Website Integration:**
  * (Out of scope for this document, but the API will be designed to support a future website).

## 4. Success Metrics

* **MVP:**
  * Successfully extracts data for a large list of item IDs without hitting Blizzard API rate limits.
  * Data is accurately stored in the SQLite database.
  * Extraction process is reasonably fast due to concurrency.
* **Future API:**
  * API endpoint is functional and returns correct data in JSON format.
  * API is performant and can handle a reasonable number of requests.

## 5. Assumptions and Risks

**Assumptions:**

* The Blizzard API provides consistent and reliable data for item class and subclass.
* The structure of the Blizzard API response for items is stable.
* SQLite is sufficient for the initial data storage needs.

**Risks:**

* **Blizzard API Changes:**  The Blizzard API structure or rate limits could change, requiring adjustments to the backend.
* **Rate Limiting Issues:**  Even with concurrency management, we might still encounter rate limiting issues if processing very large lists of items. We need to implement robust error handling and potentially retry mechanisms.
* **Data Inconsistencies:**  There might be inconsistencies or missing data in the Blizzard API itself.
