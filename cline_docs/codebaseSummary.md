# Auction Analyzer Codebase Summary

## Overview
Auction Analyzer is a comprehensive system designed to analyze auction data, integrating a Python-based backend API, a robust database layer, an automated data extraction module, and a Next.js based frontend interface. This document provides a high-level overview of the project structure and key components.

## Key Components

### Backend API
- Located in the `src/api` directory.
- Provides REST endpoints for data access and manipulation.
- Includes modules such as `main.py`, `models.py`, and various route handlers.

### Database
- Located in the `src/database` directory.
- Manages data persistence using SQL databases, with migrations managed by Alembic.
- Contains models, operations, and migration scripts.

### Data Extractor
- Located in the `src/extractor` directory.
- Responsible for fetching external auction data.
- Implements rate limiting and API client interactions.

### Frontend
- Located in the `frontend` directory.
- Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.
- Uses fetch API for backend interactions and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Contains modular components for user interface elements.

### Testing
- Unit and integration tests are located in the `tests` directory.
- Ensures system reliability and correctness.

## Data Flow
- Data is fetched via the extractor, processed by the backend API, and stored in the database.
- The frontend interacts with the backend API to display dynamic auction analysis.

## External Dependencies
- Python libraries managed via `pyproject.toml` and an isolated venv.
- Node.js packages managed via `package.json` for the frontend.

## Recent Significant Changes
- Refactored extractor scripts to improve data ingestion.
- Updated frontend components for better responsiveness.
- Enhanced database operations with new migration scripts.

## User Feedback Integration
- Regular updates based on user feedback have improved overall functionality and user experience.
