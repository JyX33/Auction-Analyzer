# Current Task Status

## Current Objective

Setting up initial project documentation and structure (Phase 1)

## Context

We are in the initial setup phase of the Blizzard Item Data Extractor project. This phase focuses on establishing proper documentation and project structure before implementing the core functionality.

## Current Focus

Reference to projectRoadmap.md: Phase 1 - Data Extraction

- [x] Initialize project documentation structure
- [x] Set up essential documentation files
- [x] Define project architecture
- [ ] Plan implementation strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Complete essential documentation setup
   - [x] Create projectRoadmap.md
   - [x] Create currentTask.md
   - [x] Create techStack.md
   - [x] Create codebaseSummary.md

2. Begin implementation preparation
   - [ ] Set up development environment
     - [ ] Create virtual environment
     - [ ] Install required dependencies
     - [ ] Configure development tools
   - [ ] Configure Blizzard API access
     - [ ] Create Blizzard developer account
     - [ ] Generate API credentials
     - [ ] Store credentials securely
   - [ ] Initialize SQLite database
     - [ ] Create database schema
     - [ ] Set up migrations
     - [ ] Implement basic queries
   - [ ] Create basic project structure
     - [ ] Set up src/ directory structure
     - [ ] Create initial module files
     - [ ] Configure testing environment

### Upcoming Tasks

1. Implement data extraction script
   - Design concurrent request system
   - Implement rate limiting logic
   - Set up error handling
   - Create extraction reporting

## Technical Considerations

- Need to implement proper concurrency control with asyncio.Semaphore
- Must handle Blizzard API rate limits effectively
- SQLite database schema needs to be properly initialized
- Error handling and reporting system must be robust

## Dependencies

- Blizzard API credentials required
- Python environment setup needed
- Required libraries must be installed (FastAPI, httpx, etc.)

## Notes

- All core documentation files have been created and organized
- Project architecture has been defined in codebaseSummary.md
- Technical stack has been defined in techStack.md
- Database schema design is documented
- Ready to proceed with environment setup and API configuration
- Planning for future phases while implementing current phase
- Consider scalability in initial design decisions
