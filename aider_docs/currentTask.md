# Current Task Status

## Current Objective

Optimize data extraction pipeline and database operations (Phase 2)

## Context

We are now focusing on optimizing the data extraction and storage mechanisms of the Blizzard Item Data Extractor project. Recent improvements have focused on efficiency and preventing unnecessary API calls and database operations.

## Current Focus

Reference to projectRoadmap.md: Phase 2 - Database & Data Management

- [x] Implement efficient batch processing
- [x] Add duplicate prevention mechanisms
- [x] Optimize database operations
- [x] Enhance extraction reporting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Performance Optimization
   - [ ] Implement database indexing for ID queries
   - [ ] Add periodic extraction scheduling
   - [ ] Monitor and tune batch sizes

2. Database Management
   - [ ] Design backup strategy
   - [ ] Implement restore functionality
   - [ ] Add data pruning mechanisms

3. Prepare for REST API Development
   - [ ] Design API endpoints
   - [ ] Plan rate limiting strategy
   - [ ] Document API specifications

### Completed Tasks

- Batch Processing Optimizations:
  - Added set-based filtering for existing items
  - Implemented 50-item batch size
  - Added 1-second inter-batch delays
  - Enhanced batch error handling
  
- Database Improvements:
  - Added connected realm duplicate prevention
  - Implemented efficient item ID lookup
  - Enhanced data validation
  - Optimized update mechanisms

- Extraction Enhancements:
  - Added skipped items tracking
  - Enhanced extraction reports
  - Improved error classification
  - Added rate limit management

- API Client Features:
  - Switched to direct item endpoint
  - Added proper error handling
  - Implemented locale-aware fetching
  - Added resilient data transformation

## Technical Considerations

- Monitor performance impact of batch size changes
- Consider database indexing strategies
- Track API rate limit usage
- Plan for scaling data volume

## Dependencies

- Blizzard API credentials
- Python environment
- Required libraries (SQLAlchemy, httpx, etc.)
- Database migration system

## Notes

- Recent optimizations show significant reduction in unnecessary API calls
- Database operations now more efficient with set-based filtering
- Rate limiting working effectively with new delay system
- Documentation kept up to date with latest changes
- Error handling and reporting providing good visibility
- Consider implementing monitoring for extraction performance
