# Current Task Status

## Current Objective

Setting up initial project documentation and structure (Phase 1)

## Context

We are in the initial setup phase of the Blizzard Item Data Extractor project. This phase focuses on establishing proper documentation and project structure before implementing the core functionality.

## Current Focus

Reference to projectRoadmap.md: Phase 1 - Data Extraction

- [x] Initialize project documentation structure
- [x] Set up essential documentation files
- [x] Define project architecture
- [x] Plan implementation strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Complete database initialization
   - [x] Create database schema
   - [x] Implement migration system
   - [ ] Add seed data loading

2. Finalize rate limiting implementation
   - [x] Basic concurrency control
   - [x] Retry logic framework
   - [ ] Implement Blizzard-specific rate limit headers

3. Prepare data extraction workflow
   - [x] Connect API client to database
   - [x] Implement batch processing
   - [ ] Create error recovery mechanisms

### Completed Tasks

- Full database initialization flow:
  - Async schema creation
  - Environment configuration
  - Migration stamping
- Core extraction features:
  - Batch processing
  - Error tracking
  - Report generation
- Rate limiter enhancements:
  - Precise timing controls
  - Retry tracking
  - Header-based error detection

## Technical Considerations

- Need to implement proper concurrency control with asyncio.Semaphore
- Must handle Blizzard API rate limits effectively
- SQLite database schema needs to be properly initialized
- Error handling and reporting system must be robust

## Dependencies

- Blizzard API credentials required
- Python environment setup needed
- Required libraries must be installed (FastAPI, httpx, etc.)

## Notes

- All core documentation files have been created and organized
- Project architecture has been defined in codebaseSummary.md
- Technical stack has been defined in techStack.md
- Database schema design is documented
- Ready to proceed with environment setup and API configuration
- Planning for future phases while implementing current phase
- Consider scalability in initial design decisions
