# Current Task Status

## Current Objective

Setting up initial project documentation and structure (Phase 1)

## Context

We are in the initial setup phase of the Blizzard Item Data Extractor project. This phase focuses on establishing proper documentation and project structure before implementing the core functionality.

## Current Focus

Reference to projectRoadmap.md: Phase 1 - Data Extraction

- [x] Initialize project documentation structure
- [x] Set up essential documentation files
- [x] Define project architecture
- [x] Plan implementation strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Complete database initialization
   - [x] Create database schema
   - [x] Implement migration system
   - [x] Add seed data loading

2. Finalize rate limiting implementation
   - [x] Basic concurrency control
   - [x] Retry logic framework
   - [x] Implement Blizzard-specific rate limit headers

3. Prepare data extraction workflow
   - [x] Connect API client to database
   - [x] Implement batch processing
   - [x] Create error recovery mechanisms

### Completed Tasks

- Full extraction error handling:
  - Nested transactions
  - Retry mechanisms
  - Error classification
- Rate limiter enhancements:
  - Header-based limit detection
  - Dynamic interval adjustment
  - Jittered backoff
- Database features:
  - Async schema creation
  - Environment configuration
  - Connection pooling
- API client enhancements:
  - Switched to direct item endpoint for better reliability
  - Added proper error handling for empty responses
  - Implemented locale-aware data fetching
  - Added resilient data transformation
- Error handling improvements:
  - Added response validation
  - Improved error reporting
  - Enhanced data transformation resilience

## Technical Considerations

- Need to implement proper concurrency control with asyncio.Semaphore
- Must handle Blizzard API rate limits effectively
- SQLite database schema needs to be properly initialized
- Error handling and reporting system must be robust

## Dependencies

- Blizzard API credentials required
- Python environment setup needed
- Required libraries must be installed (FastAPI, httpx, etc.)

## Notes

- All core documentation files have been created and organized
- Project architecture has been defined in codebaseSummary.md
- Technical stack has been defined in techStack.md
- Database schema design is documented
- Ready to proceed with environment setup and API configuration
- Planning for future phases while implementing current phase
- Consider scalability in initial design decisions
