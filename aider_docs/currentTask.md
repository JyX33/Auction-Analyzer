# Current Task Status

## Current Objective

Setting up initial project documentation and structure (Phase 1)

## Context

We are in the initial setup phase of the Blizzard Item Data Extractor project. This phase focuses on establishing proper documentation and project structure before implementing the core functionality.

## Current Focus

Reference to projectRoadmap.md: Phase 1 - Data Extraction

- [x] Initialize project documentation structure
- [ ] Set up essential documentation files
- [ ] Define project architecture
- [ ] Plan implementation strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Complete essential documentation setup
   - [x] Create projectRoadmap.md
   - [x] Create currentTask.md
   - [ ] Create techStack.md
   - [ ] Create codebaseSummary.md

2. Begin implementation preparation
   - [ ] Set up development environment
   - [ ] Configure Blizzard API access
   - [ ] Initialize SQLite database
   - [ ] Create basic project structure

### Upcoming Tasks

1. Implement data extraction script
   - Design concurrent request system
   - Implement rate limiting logic
   - Set up error handling
   - Create extraction reporting

## Technical Considerations

- Need to implement proper concurrency control with asyncio.Semaphore
- Must handle Blizzard API rate limits effectively
- SQLite database schema needs to be properly initialized
- Error handling and reporting system must be robust

## Dependencies

- Blizzard API credentials required
- Python environment setup needed
- Required libraries must be installed (FastAPI, httpx, etc.)

## Notes

- Current focus is on documentation and setup
- Need to ensure all documentation is clear and maintainable
- Planning for future phases while implementing current phase
- Consider scalability in initial design decisions
